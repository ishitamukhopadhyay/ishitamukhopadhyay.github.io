# Education

### Ph.D.
I received my PhD in 2014 in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) from **Cornell University** (Ithaca, New York, USA).
I investigated techniques to improve the accuracy of **thermometer coded DAC**, whose resolution, which is severely affected under _process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations_, is critical for the _calibration purposes_ of many circuit blocks in high speed I/O. For my PhD work, I proposed a **dual-calibration technique** which achieves an improvement of 36% in _differential non-linearity (DNL)_ and 50% in _integral non-linearity (INL)_ across several chip measurements. I developed mathematical models of the proposed technique enabling the determination of overall yield.
I also worked on **modeling high speed I/O links** and observed the effect of non-linearity of DACs on different circuit blocks like phase interpolator and how overall performance is affected in terms of _bit error rate (BER)_.
During the course of my PhD, I've had experience in designing various RF circuits like VCOs, LNAs, op-amps, mixers, PLLs and have also had hands-on experience in using various lab equipment and wire-bonding.

### M.S.
I received my Master of Science degree in 2013 in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) from Cornell University (Ithaca, New York, USA).

### M.Tech.
I received my Master of Technology degree in 2009 in information and communication technology from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (India).
I worked on **error correction for VLSI logic synthesis** to _improve reliability_ of nanoscale digital circuits. I investigated _communications techniques_ for compensating the detrimental effects of reduced noise margin and the inherent unreliability of nanoscale transistors. Based on my findings, I proposed a new error correction scheme using learning techniques like **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for VLSI logic synthesis when working with lower supply voltage and increased frequency of operation.

### B.Tech.
I received my Bachelor of Technology degree in 2008 in electrical engineering (EE) from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (India).
